Description: Recalls are an appropriate alternative method for removing or correcting marketed consumer products, their labeling, and/or promotional literature that violate the laws administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recalls afford equal consumer protection but generally are more efficient and timely than formal administrative or civil actions, especially when the product has been widely distributed.

Analysis will be on:

    Types of products that are recalled 

    Time it takes to close a recall

    Which States are impacted by recalls

    Volume of recalls per product or per State
